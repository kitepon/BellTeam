# Device Hub

Manage the simulated and physical devices that you use to test your app.

## Overview

You manage all the devices that appear in Xcode as run destinations using Device Hub.

Run your app on simulated devices in Device Hub to quickly evaluate new features and fix bugs, and to see how your interface works on devices that you don’t have physical access to. Run your app on physical devices to test features or services that have hardware dependencies or investigating performance issues. For more information, see [Running your app on simulated or physical devices](/documentation/Xcode/running-your-app-on-simulated-or-physical-devices).

In Xcode, when you run your app on a simulated or physical device, Device Hub opens a compact window showing your app on a device screen where you can interact with it using your Mac controls. For physical devices, you can interact with the view in Device Hub and the physical device simultaneously. For more information, see [Interacting with your app in Device Hub](/documentation/Xcode/interacting-with-your-app-in-device-hub).

For more controls, expand the Device Hub compact window to show the sidebar, canvas, and inspector areas separately. Use the inspector to change the appearance of a device, get basic information (such as the name, operating system version, and device ID), download diagnostic files, and more.

To manage your simulated and physical devices, select a device in the sidebar to see the status in the canvas. To add physical devices, use Device Hub to pair devices wirelessly or using a cable connected to your Mac. For more information, see [Managing your simulated and physical devices in Device Hub](/documentation/Xcode/managing-your-simulated-and-physical-devices-in-device-hub).

## Topics

### Essentials

[Running your app on simulated or physical devices](/documentation/Xcode/running-your-app-on-simulated-or-physical-devices)

Launch your app on a simulated iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS device, or on a physical device paired with your Mac.

[Managing your simulated and physical devices in Device Hub](/documentation/Xcode/managing-your-simulated-and-physical-devices-in-device-hub)

Add custom simulators and pair physical devices with your Mac so you can choose them as run destinations in Xcode.

[Enabling Developer Mode on a device](/documentation/Xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device)

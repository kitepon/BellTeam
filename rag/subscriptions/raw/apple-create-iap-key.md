# Creating API keys to authorize API requests

Create API keys you use to sign JSON Web Tokens and authorize API requests.

## Discussion

The [`App Store Server API`](/documentation/AppStoreServerAPI), the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/AdvancedCommerceAPI>, and the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/ExternalPurchaseServerAPI> require JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authorize each request you make to the API. You generate JWTs using a private API key that you download from App Store Connect. For information about generating the JWT using your private key, see [Generating JSON Web Tokens for API requests](/documentation/AppStoreServerAPI/generating-json-web-tokens-for-api-requests).

An API key has two parts: a public portion that Apple keeps, and a private key that you download. Use the private key to sign tokens that authorize the API to access or submit your data to the App Store.

> Important:
> Store your private keys in a secure place. Don’t share your keys, don’t store keys in a code repository, and don’t include keys in client-side code. If you suspect a private key is compromised, immediately revoke the key in App Store Connect. See <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/AppStoreConnectAPI/revoking-api-keys> for details.

Use the API key for the App Store Server API, the Advanced Commerce API, and the External Purchase Server API. You can’t use the key for other Apple services.

### Generate a private key

To generate an API key to use with the App Store Server API, the Advanced Commerce API, and the External Purchase Server API, log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and complete the following steps:

1. On the homepage, click Users and Access.
2. Click the Integrations tab.
3. In the sidebar under Keys, click In-App Purchase.
4. Click Generate In-App Purchase Key.
   If you already have an Active In-App Purchase key generated, click the Add (+) icon to add more.
5. Enter a name for the key. The name is for your reference only and is not part of the key itself.
6. Click Generate.

After you generate an in-app purchase key, you cannot edit its name. If you need to make changes, revoke the key and generate a new one.

The new key’s name, key ID, a download link, and other information appear on the page.

### Download and store the private key

After generating your API key, App Store Connect gives you the opportunity to download the private half of the key. The private key is only available for download a single time.

1. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).
2. On the homepage, click Users and Access.
3. Click the Integrations tab.
4. In the sidebar under Keys, click In-App Purchase.
5. Navigate to a key under the Active section, then click Download Key for the key you want to download.
6. In the dialog, click Download.

The download link appears only if you haven’t yet downloaded the private key. Apple doesn’t keep a copy of the private key. Store your private key in a secure place.
